Networking scratch notes:

First, run this to create a virtual switch that the VMs connect to:
vde_switch --sock vde1.ctl --dirmode 0700 --hub

Optionally, run this to create a virtual network interface on the host to allow it to communicate with the VMs:
sudo vde_plug2tap --sock vde1.ctl tap0

We will need to manually assign the IPs using `ip addr`/`ip link`
